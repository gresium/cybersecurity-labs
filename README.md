# Cybersecurity Labs 

A collection of hands-on cybersecurity projects built during my **Simplilearn x IIT Kanpur alumni program**, combined with independent lab work.

This repository documents my learning journey through **practical security exercises**, focusing on understanding how attacks work and how systems can be defended in real-world scenarios.

## About This Repository

The goal of this repository is simple:
- Learn by **doing**
- Practice in **safe, legal lab environments**
- Build a solid foundation across multiple cybersecurity domains

Each project reflects topics covered in a structured cybersecurity curriculum and is documented to show **process, findings, and takeaways**, not just results.

## What I Learned

### 🔐 Core Foundations
- Cybersecurity principles and threat models  
- Security architecture basics  
- Risk, compliance, and cyber laws  

### 💻 Operating Systems
- Linux and Windows fundamentals  
- User management, permissions, and system hardening  
- Service configuration and logging  

### 🌐 Networking & Infrastructure
- TCP/IP, DNS, routing, and firewall concepts  
- Network enumeration and traffic analysis  
- Secure network design fundamentals  

### 🌍 Application & Web Security
- Common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)  
- Vulnerability discovery and assessment  
- Secure application design principles  

### 🧑‍💻 Ethical Hacking & Pentesting
- Reconnaissance and enumeration  
- Credential attacks and brute-force analysis  
- Exploitation methodology (lab-based)  
- Post-exploitation concepts  

### 🦠 Malware & Incident Response
- Malware and ransomware behavior analysis  
- Detection and response fundamentals  
- Defensive strategies and mitigation techniques  

### ☁️ Cloud & Enterprise Security
- Cloud security fundamentals  
- Identity and access management  
- Enterprise infrastructure protection  


Each folder typically includes:
- A short description of the lab
- Tools and techniques used
- Observations and findings
- Security lessons learned

## Example Projects

- **Minimal Honeypot**  
  Implemented a lightweight honeypot to capture unauthorized access attempts and analyze attacker behavior through logs.

- **SSH Brute-Force Analysis**  
  Studied real brute-force patterns against an SSH service to better understand common attack techniques.

- **Vulnerability Assessment Labs**  
  Practiced identifying and evaluating vulnerabilities in controlled environments.

- **Reconnaissance & Information Gathering**  
  Explored how exposed services, metadata, and digital footprints can be discovered.

## Tools & Technologies

- Linux & Windows  
- SSH  
- Networking and enumeration tools  
- Vulnerability scanners  
- Python (for security scripting and analysis)  
- Git & GitHub for documentation  

## Disclaimer ⚠️

All work in this repository was performed in **legal, isolated lab environments** for educational purposes only.  
No real-world systems were targeted or harmed.
