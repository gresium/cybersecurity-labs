# Conducting Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing on a Simulated Web Application
Hands-on VAPT engagement against a deliberately vulnerable web application environment with hidden flags, misconfigurations, and exploitable functionalities.
Overview
This project demonstrates a full end-to-end Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Test against a vulnerable web application running on a pre-built VM. The environment contained multiple intentional weaknesses and hidden “flags” to simulate real-world exploitation scenarios.
The objective was to apply industry-standard offensive workflows, uncover critical findings, validate exploitation paths, and document actionable remediation measures.
This mirrors how a security consultant approaches a client engagement: controlled exploitation, evidence capture, and structured reporting.

# Objectives
• Identify weaknesses in the simulated web application
• Enumerate exposed services and attack surfaces
• Intercept and manipulate traffic using Burp Suite
• Exploit authentication, input validation, and access control flaws
• Locate and retrieve hidden flags
• Provide remediation aligned with OWASP ASVS

# Environment
• Vulnerable Web App VM (OVA imported locally)
• Browser + Burp Suite Community
• Windows 10 host + Kali Linux VM (optional testing)
• Local network NAT environment
• Target reachable via browser after VM boot-up

# Tools Used
• Burp Suite (Proxy, Repeater, Decoder)
• Nmap
• JavaScript console
• Browser DevTools
• Wordlists (directory/content brute-forcing)
• Built-in VM challenge scripts and hidden endpoints

# Methodology
1. Reconnaissance
• Identified webserver technologies via headers
• Discovered login pages, product pages, hidden parameters
• Performed directory discovery for admin panels and hidden resources
2. Traffic Interception
• Configured Burp Suite to intercept all HTTP requests
• Observed session cookies, roles, and parameter handling
• Identified weak input validation patterns
3. Authentication Attacks
• Tested weak-password vectors
• Identified login request structure via Burp
• Found vulnerable endpoints that accepted malformed input
• Gained access to restricted sections (flag locations)
4. Injection & Manipulation
• Modified request parameters to bypass restrictions
• Observed server responses for flag confirmation
• Executed forced browsing to access unintended resources

 # 5. Vulnerability Identification
    Key flaws identified:
• Weak authentication controls
• Missing input sanitization
• Directory exposure
• Predictable parameter naming
• Unprotected admin panels
• Information disclosure through verbose error messages

# 6. Flag Discovery
Located flags through:
• Hidden directories
• Exposed API endpoints
• Burp request tampering
• Intercepting and modifying parameters
• Observing backend responses

# Key Findings
Authentication Bypass possible via modified POST requests
Directory enumeration revealed sensitive admin paths
Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) exposed user data
Missing access control on high-privileged endpoints
Hardcoded credentials present in source code
Verbose error messages leaked environment info

# Recommendations
• Enforce strict server-side authentication validation
• Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
• Sanitize all user input following OWASP guidelines
• Restrict directory listing at the webserver level
• Remove hardcoded secrets from code
• Use secure session handling (HttpOnly, Secure cookies)
• Implement centralized error handling without stack traces
